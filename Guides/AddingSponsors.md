# Adding Sponsor Logos
If a sponsor has a logo that they wish to show on stream, you can add it into OBS following the templates below.

##  Use the template
We have a template provided below and in the `Other` folder.

![Logo Template](/Other/LogoTemplate.png)

This template defines the "Safe" region for the logo. OBS will auto scale the logo to fit in the 500x250 bounds for the logo scroller.

## Adding the logo to the scroller
- Start up OBS and head to the `INPLAY` scroller.
- Click the `Add Files` button and navigate to the sponsor logo.

OBS should now start scrolling through logos. <!-- hopefully..... if not something borked during import, but lets not mention that. since you can see this, you may know a bit about OBS, so you should figure it out. i have hope in you <3 -->

> [!NOTE]
> Sponsors added across all teams will have a logo modified and uploaded to this repo in the assets folder.
