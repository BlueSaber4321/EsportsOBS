# Booth Commentary
## How to Mute/Unmute Microphone
On the microphone, there is a button on the front. If it is solid red, then the mic is on, or as we call it hot. 

If the button is flashing red, then it is muted.

## General Playout
There is a general playout that happens during a stream:
- Welcome everyone to the stream a little before starting
- Get into game and commentate
- Keep the mic live as much as possible so people dont think the stream is frozen, and to keep people entertained
- End off the stream by thanking everyone for watching (If we win, we give a little interview if the players want one.)
